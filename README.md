Nvidirubidium is a fork of Rubidium, an alternate rendering backing for sodium. It uses cutting edge nvidia features to render huge amounts of
terrain geometry at very playable framerates. The difference is Nvidirubidium is for embeddium (Forge) to be used with Sinytra Connector.

### Requires embeddium and an Nvidia GTX 1600 series or newer to run (turing+ architecture)
